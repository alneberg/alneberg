I found that one repository "lotstedt" caused an error in my script (now fixed with "try"), 
I could use the api to further investigate this repos. Turned out it was just empty.
It would sometimes be useful to check all repositories in an organization for open issues,
this was really easy in the api. No repo had any issue when I checked. However, all
repositories had the issue feature activated. This might be useful when administrating
all repos in an organization.
